# Introduction
I've always liked board games, especially figuring out how to play them optimally. This is an bare implementation of one such board game so that I can play with strategies. It isn't a playable implementation of the game.

# Getting Started
This is intended to have the source edited and be ran within VS. Right now it's unclear the what the exact best form for it should be but it has a console app that serves as the starting point. From there you'll probably want to implement your own Player and see how it fares.

# Contribute
* It's probably riddled with bugs, and violates the single responsibility principal in a few places.
* It's lacking any sort of testing, be it unit testing or a framework for evaluating Players.
* If that didn't scare you off feel free to mess with it or just chat about it.
